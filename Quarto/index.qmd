title: "GVC: Graph-Vertex Coloring"
---
**GVC** is a hub meant to facilitate and encourage developments regarding the **G**raph-**V**ertex **C**oloring problem.
To accomplish this, it provides the following functionalities:

- An Instance Space Analysis tool
    - Feature gathering from instances
    - Performance measures from a set of predefined algorithms
    - The ability to upload user algorithms to compare
- A package to extract the features locally.
- A rank Based analysis page, which encorporates all algorithms available to the page.

These features are all available through the pages associated Github organisation <https://github.com/GraphVertexColoring/>

For an explanation on how to use the different aspects see [Getting Started](HowTo.qmd)

## Beta
An Initial beta version of this site can be found at <https://denatyeti.github.io/GVC-validator/>. This initial version contains only some of the functionalities and is no longer maintained.
