This Repository handles all work regarding the webpage, This includes performing ISA, generating and updating pages, rendering, publishing and deploying the webpage.

## TODO:
1. Update the text on the different subpages 
    This includes the how to use page as it is currently only showing the old pages.
        Information about the boxplot page should also be added.
2. Update the text on the front page, could take inspiration from coco here as it is currently a bit too empty
